# Chapter 4: Wireless and RF Attacks

## Wireless Exploits (Wi-Fi / 802.11 Technologies)
* **Nature of the Medium:** Broadcast technology is inherently wide open, making it highly susceptible to interception and external manipulation.

### Tools
* **Aircrack-ng:** Suite of tools used for auditing and cracking wireless networks.
* **Wireshark:** Used for capturing and deeply analyzing network traffic.

### Exploit Techniques
* **Evil Twin:** A rogue Wireless Access Point (WAP) used to eavesdrop on users. It is configured with the exact same SSID as a valid, trusted network.
* **Karma Attack:** An automated, self-referencing radio attack where the attacker's machine listens for wireless probe requests and automatically spins up an evil twin AP matching the requested SSID.
* **Downgrade Attacks:** Forces a client device to negotiate down to an older or more vulnerable security protocol.
* **Deauthentication Attacks:** A form of Denial of Service (DoS) attack that disrupts active communication by spoofing management frames, disconnecting the user from the WAP.
* **Fragmentation Attacks:** A form of DoS attack that floods the network with malicious datagram fragments, overwhelming the system with too many data pieces.
* **Credential Harvesting:** Leveraging social engineering tactics alongside wireless infrastructure to capture or discover user login credentials.
* **WPS Implementation Weakness:** Exploits flaws in consumer-grade WAPs, allowing an attacker to brute-force or learn the WPS PIN to connect without standard authentication (or connect via the PIN only).

## Bluetooth & RF Attacks
* **Bluejacking:** Sending unsolicited messages to a Bluetooth-enabled device (primarily a nuisance attack).
* **Bluesnarfing:** The unauthorized access and theft of information (contacts, data, or files) from a Bluetooth-enabled device.
* **RFID Cloning:** Making an unauthorized copy of a device's Radio Frequency signal to replicate cards or badges.
* **Jamming:** A physical-layer DoS attack that transmits interference to completely disable communication among wireless devices.
* **Repeating:** Intercepting, capturing, and retransmitting an RF signal to artificially increase its range or replay a command.

## Types of Wireless Exploit Outcomes
* **Data Modification:** Altering actionable data in transit; typically focused on easing further access or launching deeper attacks.
* **Data Corruption:** Attacks aimed directly at data integrity and availability (DoS).
* **Capture Handshakes:** Sniffing authentication handshakes to be used later in offline cracking, replay attacks, or impersonation attacks.
* **On-Path Attacks:** Traditionally known as Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks, placing the attacker directly between the victim and the network gateway.
